## Contributing guidelines

I'm not actively seeking contributors, but if you have a pull request I'm happy to take a look!

Some guidelines:

-   I'm not seeking additional keyword prompts. There's already a lot!
-   UI changes must reasonably accomodate iPhone 5 screens (320x568)
-   FAO is simple, not ambitious. The old Crabhat Spyfall webapp was a huge inspiration for me, and it was pretty minimalistic.
-   As a rule of thumb, I'm hesitant to make changes, additions, or enforcements to the _rules_ of the game. Think of the people with house rules!

If you have questions, feel free to email me or create a feature request for discussion.

I'm also totally cool with people hosting their own forks, as long as there's credit to the original repo.
