					<h2>Rules</h2>
					<p>A group of artists must work together to find the one <strong>fake artist</strong> among them, while that person tries to avoid detection.</p>
					<p>Each round, all artists receive a random keyword and its hint/category, e.g. <span>"Apple (Food)".</span></p>
					<p>But the faker <em>only receives the hint</em>.</p>
					<p>Players take turns drawing single strokes on the drawing pad. After every player has drawn twice, everyone votes on who they think the fake artist is.</p>
					<p>The fake artist has to bluff their way through the drawing, while the artists try to draw enough to prove they know the keyword - but draw too obviously, and the fake artist might catch on!</p>
					<p>And even if the fake artist gets caught at the end, if they're able to correctly guess the keyword, <em>they still win!</em></p>
